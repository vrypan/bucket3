It reads your content and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server.\r\n\r\nbucket3 would like to become a virtual “information bucket” where you throw \r\npieces of information (texts, images, audio, etc), and presents them in a nice \r\nblog-like format.\r\n\r\n# Quick intro\r\n\r\nInstall bucket3\r\n\r\n```\r\npip install bucket3\r\n```\r\n\r\nCreate a local directory to hold your blog and initialize a new bucket3 blog\r\n\r\n```\r\nmkdir myblog\r\ncd myblog \r\nbucket3 init\r\n```\r\n\r\nConfigure your blog: Edit bucket3.conf.yaml and set your blog name, URL, etc.\r\n\r\nCreate a new post\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd posts\r\nbucket3 new hello-world-1 \r\n```\r\n\r\nEdit the generated .md file, and add some text.\r\n\r\nGenerate/update your blog's HTML.\r\n\r\n```\r\nbucket3 update\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou should now have your whole blog under \"html\" (as defined in your conf file).\r\n\r\nUpload the contents of html/ to your server.\r\n\r\n# Examples\r\n\r\n- http://blog.vrypan.net/\r\n\r\n# License\r\n\r\nbucket3 is distributed under the MIT LICENSE.\r\n\r\n# Copyright\r\n\r\nPanayotis Vryonis, http://www.vrypan.net/\r\n\r\nSee also\r\n=========\r\nIf you are not familiar with the idea of a static HTML blog, visit https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll they've done a much better way at explaining it!
